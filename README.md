WP random post w/mods to IMG tag

* Gets a random post using WP loop.
* Processes shortcodes
* Copies src attribute in IMG tag to HTML5 data- attribute
* Adds a class to Anchor tags (for colorbox)

This PHP file simply prepares the WP post to not display images but instead allow a lazy loader to load them later.

The lazy loader is written in javascript and is located here: <a href="https://github.com/charlie8230/lll/">LLL</a>.
