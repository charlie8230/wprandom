WP random post w/mods to IMG tag

* Gets a random post using WP loop.
* Processes shortcodes
* Copies src attribute in IMG tag to HTML5 data- attribute
* Adds a class to <A> tags (for lightbox)

This PHP file simply prepares the WP post to not display images but instead allow a lazy loader to load them later.

The lazy loader is written in javascript
